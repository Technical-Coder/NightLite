# NightLite
A light powered by a Raspberry Pi that adjusts its brightness based on how bright/dark it is.

## Running
Run the following command in the terminal when you are in the same directory as the program: ```sudo python3 main.py```.

## The Wiring
### Assuming you are using a half-size breadboard (I'm not sure if the sizes make a difference) that is placed vertically, with a1 being in the top left:
---
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: GND -> f5
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 17 -> b1
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 22 -> b4
- 1k Ohm Resistor: d1 -> f1
- 1k Ohm Resistor: d4 -> f4
- 330 nF Capacitor: h4 (-) -> j5 (+)
- Photoresistor: j1 -> j4
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 18 -> a10
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: GND -> a17
- 1k Ohm Resistor: c10 -> c15
- White LED: e15 (+) -> e17 (-)
---
### Double-check your wiring. It's really easy to mix up this stuff, and I do it all the time too. If you find something wrong with this wiring, please let me know immediately in the issues section.

## How It Works

First, we dischare everything in the capacitor so that there is no energy left over to mess up the reading. Then we want to charge the capacitor with the current coming through the photoreistor. The capacitor will fill faster/slower if there is less/more resistance from the photoresistor. The resistance varies depending on the light level, meening that we can use the amount of time it takes to charge the capacitor to find how bright/dark it is. To do that, we have to use the time constant. For one time constant (1 Tau), the capacitor will rise to approximately 63.2% of the original input/charge voltage. The time constant can be found by multiplying the input voltage, the percentage of the voltage expected, and the time it took to charge. So that gives us T = time * 3.3 * 0.632, with T being one time constant.
