# NightLite
A light that adjusts its brightness based on how bright/dark it is.

## The Wiring
### Assuming you are using a half-size breadboard (I'm not sure if the sizes make a difference) that is placed vertically, with a1 being in the top left:
---
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: GND -> f5
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 17 -> b1
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 22 -> b4
- 1k Ohm Resistor: d1 -> f1
- 1k Ohm Resistor: d4 -> f4
- 330 nF Capacitor: h4 (-) -> j5 (+)
- Photoresistor: j1 -> j4
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: 18 -> a10
- Female to Male Jumper Wire: GND -> a17
- 1k Ohm Resistor: c10 -> c15
- White LED: e15 (+) -> e17 (-)
---
### Double-check your wiring. It's really easy to mix up this stuff, and I do it all the time too. If you find something wrong with this wiring, please let me know immediately in the issues section.
